MATLAB is a great piece of software, but it currently costs $49.00 for a student license and requires a site license to be used on school computers. Subsequently, it is costly for a student to use MATLAB and it is costly for a college to support a course that uses MATLAB. In addition, this site license expires eventually and students need to purchase another copy often before they finish their degree.\n\n\nThe Python programming language, on the other hand, is open source and free. To download and use Python, the cost to both the student and the college is zero (minus time spent). By moving an undergraduate engineering programming class to Python, students will save money and have greater access to the software they use in class. Further in their engineering education, students can continue to use Python for free.",

What makes Python useful for solving problems?\n\n\nPython is a powerful programming language\n\n\nPython defines the types of objects you build into your code. Unlike some other languages such as C, you do not need to declare the object type. The object type is also mutable, you can change the type of object easily and on the fly. There is a wide array of object types built into Python. Objects can change in size. Python objects can also contain mixed data types. Strings and floating point numbers can be part of the same list.\n\n\nPython has an extensive Standard Library. A huge number of object types, functions and methods are available for use without importing any external modules. These include math functions, list methods, and calls to a computer's system. There is a lot that can be done with the Python Standard Library. The first couple of chapters of this book will just use the standard library. It can do a lot.\n\n\nPython has over 100,000 external packages available for download and use. They are easy to install off of the Python Package Index, commonly called PyPI (\"pie pee eye\"). There is a Python package for just about everything. There are packages which can help you: interact with the web, make complex computations, calculate unit conversions, plot data, work with .csv, .xls, and .pdf files, manipulate images and video, read data from sensors and test equipment, train machine learning algorithms, design web apps, work with GIS data, work with astronautical data. There are and many more Python packages added to PyPI every day. In this book, we will use some of the more useful Python packages for problem solvers such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.\n\n\nPython is easy to learn and use\n\n\nOne way Problem solvers code solutions faster in Python faster than coding solutions in other programming languages is that Python is easy to learn and use. Python programs tend to be shorter and quicker to write than a program which completes a similar function in another languages. In the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle programming solutions in Python can be written and tested quickly. Python is also an easy language for fellow problem solvers on your team to learn. Python's language syntax is also quite human readable. While programmers can become preoccupied with a program's runtime, it is development time that takes the longest.\n\n\nPython is transportable\n\n\nPython can be installed and run on each of the three major operating systems: Windows, Mac and Linux. On Mac and Linux Python comes installed out of the box. Just open up a terminal in on a MacOS or Linux machine and type \npython\n. That's it, you are now using Python. On Windows, I recommend downloading and installing the Anaconda distribution of Python. The Anaconda distribution of Python is free and can be installed on all three major operating systems.\n\n\nPython is free\n\n\nSome computer languages used for problem solving such as MATLAB and LabView cost money to download and install. Python is free to download and use. Python is also open source and individuals are free to modify, contribute to, and propose improvements to Python. All of the packages available on the Python Package Index are free to download and install. Many more packages, scripts and utilities can be found in open source code repositories on GitHub and BitBucket. \n\n\nPython is growing\n\n\nPython is growing in popularity. Python is particularly growing in the data sciences and in use with GIS systems, physical modeling, machine learning and computer vision. These are growing team problem-solving areas for engineers.",

The following section details the differences between the Anaconda distribution of Python and the version of Python you can download from \nPython.org\n\n\nHow is Anaconda different from Python?\n\n\nWhen you download Python from Python.org, you get the \nPython Interpreter\n, a little text editing program called \nIDLE\n and all of the Python Standard Library modules. \n\n\nThe Python Interpreter is an application or program that runs your Python code. A program written in the Python programming language is run with the Python Interpreter. So Python corresponds to both the language that a program is written in as well as the application that runs the program.\n\n\nWhen you download the Anaconda distribution of Python from Anaconda.com, you get a Python Interpreter, the \nAnaconda Prompt\n (a command line program), \nSpyder\n (a code editor) and about 600 extra Python modules that aren't included in the Python Standard Library. The Anaconda distribution of Python also includes a program called Anaconda Navigator that allows you to launch Jupyter notebooks quickly.\n\n\nWhy download Anaconda, if I want to use is Python?\n\n\nRegardless if you download Python from Python.org or if you download Anaconda (with all the extra stuff it comes with) from Anaconda.com, you will be able to write and execute Python code. However, there are a couple of advantages to using the Anaconda distribution of Python.\n\n\nAnaconda includes Python plus about 600 additional Python packages\n\n\nThe Anaconda distribution of Python is advantageous because it includes Python as well as about 600 additional Python packages. These additional packages are all free to install. The packages that come with Anaconda includes many of the most common Python packages use to solve problems. If you download Anaconda, you get Python including the Python Standard Library plus about 600 extra packages. If you download Python from Python.org, you just get Python and The Standard Library but no additional modules. You could install the extra modules that come with Anaconda (that don't come with plain old Python), but why not save a step (or about 600 steps) and just install Anaconda instead of installing about 600 different modules?\n\n\nAnaconda installs without administrator privileges\n\n\nEven if you don't have the ability to install programs on a computer, like a computer in a school computer lab, you can still download and use Anaconda. The Anaconda distribution of Python will also allow you to install additional modules from the Python package index (\nPyPI.org\n) and conda-forge (\nconda-forge.org\n), the conda package index.\n\n\nAnaconda works on MacOS\n\n\nIf you use MacOS, you probably already have Python installed on your computer. Most MacOS installations come with Python included. The problem is that the version of Python that comes with MacOS is old (usually legacy Python, Python 2) and the version of Python that comes with MacOS is locked up behind a set of administrator privileges. Because the pre-installed version of Python included with MacOS can require administrator privileges, you can have trouble with installation and run-time problems. Some things will seem to work fine, and then other things won't run at all, or you will keep getting asked for an administrator password over and over. \n\n\nDownloading and installing Anaconda (separate from the version of Python that came with MacOS) prevents most of the problems on MacOS caused by using the pre-installed version of Python.\n\n\nAnaconda makes package management and virtual environments easier\n\n\nAnother advantage of Anaconda is that package management and virtual environments are a lot easier when you have Anaconda. Virtual environments and package handling might not seem to make a huge difference right now. If you just downloaded Anaconda for the first time, you are probably not dealing with package management and virtual environments yet. (It's OK if you don't even know what those two things are yet).

These include \n+\n , \n-\n, \n*\n, \n/\n like we saw in the previous section. However, not all functions will work right away when Python starts. Say we want to find the sine of an angle. Try the following:\n\n\n>>> sin(60)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nThis error results because we have not told Python to include the \nsin\n function. The \nsin\n function is part of the \nPython Standard Library\n. The Python Standard Library comes with every Python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new Python REPL session. To use Python's \nsin\n function, first import the \nsin\n function from the \nmath\n \nmodule\n which is part of the Python Standard Library. \n\n\nImporting modules and functions is easy. Use the following syntax: \n\n\nfrom module import function\n\n\n\n\nTo import the \nsin()\n function from the \nmath\n module try:\n\n\n>>> from math import sin\n>>> sin(60)\n-0.3048106211022167\n\n\n\n\nSuccess! Multiple modules can be imported at the same time. Say we want to use a bunch of different trig functions to solve the following problem.\n\n\nAn angle has a value of \n\\pi\n\\pi\n/6 radians. What is the sine, cos, and tangent of the angle?\n\n\nTo solve this problem we need to import the \nsin()\n, \ncos()\n, and \ntan()\n functions. It is also useful to have the value of \n\\pi\n\\pi\n, rather than having to write \n3.14....\n We can import all of these functions at the same time using the syntax:\n\n\nfrom module import function1, function2, function3\n\n\n\n\nNote the commas in between the function names. \n\n\nTry:\n\n\n>>> from math import sin, cos, tan, pi\n>>> pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> sin(pi/6)\n0.49999999999999994\n>>> >>> cos(pi/6)\n0.8660254037844387\n>>> tan(pi/6)\n0.5773502691896257\n\n\n\n\nSection Summary\n\n\nThe following trig functions are part of Python's \nmath\n module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrig function\n\n\nname\n\n\ndescription\n\n\nexample\n\n\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.pi\n\n\npi\n\n\nmathematical constant \n\\pi\n\\pi\n\n\nmath.pi\n\n\n3.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.sin()\n\n\nsine\n\n\nsine of an angle in radians\n\n\nmath.sin(4)\n\n\n9.025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.cos()\n\n\ncosine\n\n\ncosine of an angle in radians\n\n\ncos(3.1)\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.tan()\n\n\ntangent\n\n\ntangent of an angle in radians\n\n\ntan(100)\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.asin()\n\n\narc sine\n\n\ninverse sine, ouput in radians\n\n\nmath.sin(4)\n\n\n9.025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.acos()\n\n\narc cosine\n\n\ninverse cosine, ouput in radians\n\n\nlog(3.1)\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.atan()\n\n\narc tangent\n\n\ninverse tangent, ouput in radians\n\n\natan(100)\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.radians()\n\n\nradians conversion\n\n\ndegrees to radians\n\n\nmath.radians(90)\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmath.degress()\n\n\ndegree conversion\n\n\nradians to degrees\n\n\nmath.degrees(2)\n\n\n114.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExponents and Logarithms\n\n\nCalculating exponents and logarithms with Python is easy.

These functions are part of the Python Standard Library, but not part of the \nmath\n module. To access Python's statistics functions, we need to import them from the \nstatistics\n module using the statement \nfrom statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev\n. Then the functions \nmean\n, \nmedian\n, \nmode\n and \nstdev\n(standard deviation) can be used.  \n\n\n>>> from statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev\n\n>>> test_scores = [60, 83, 83, 91, 100]\n\n>>> mean(test_scores)\n83.4\n\n>>> median(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> mode(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> stdev(test_scores)\n14.842506526863986 \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can import the entire \nstatistics\n module using the statement \nimport statistics\n. Then to use the functions, we need to use the names \nstatistics.mean\n, \nstatistics.median\n, \nstatistics.mode\n, and \nstatistics.stdev\n. See below:\n\n\n>>> import statistics\n\n>>> test_scores = [60, 83, 83, 91, 100 ]\n\n>>> statistics.mean(test_scores)\n83.4\n\n>>> statistics.median(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> statistics.mode(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> statistics.stdev(test_scores)\n14.842506526863986 \n\n\n\n\nSection Summary\n\n\nThe following functions are part of Python's \nstatistics\n module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistics module function\n\n\nname\n\n\ndescription\n\n\nexample\n\n\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean()\n\n\nmean\n\n\nmean or average\n\n\nmean([1,4,5,5])\n\n\n3.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedian()\n\n\nmedian\n\n\nmiddle value\n\n\nmedian([1,4,5,5])\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode()\n\n\nmode\n\n\nmost often\n\n\nmode([1,4,5,5])\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstdev()\n\n\nstandard deviation\n\n\nspread of data\n\n\nstdev([1,4,5,5])\n\n\n1.892\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariance()\n\n\nvariance\n\n\nvariance of data\n\n\nvariance([1,4,5,5])\n\n\n3.583",

To use Python's trig functions, we need to introduce a new concept:  importing modules .   In Python, there are many operations built into the language when the REPL starts. These include  +  ,  - ,  * ,  /  like we saw in the previous section. However, not all functions will work right away when Python starts. Say we want to find the sine of an angle. Try the following:  >>> sin(60)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'sin' is not defined  This error results because we have not told Python to include the  sin  function. The  sin  function is part of the  Python Standard Library . The Python Standard Library comes with every Python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new Python REPL session. To use Python's  sin  function, first import the  sin  function from the  math   module  which is part of the Python Standard Library.   Importing modules and functions is easy. Use the following syntax:   from module import function  To import the  sin()  function from the  math  module try:  >>> from math import sin\n>>> sin(60)\n-0.3048106211022167  Success! Multiple modules can be imported at the same time. Say we want to use a bunch of different trig functions to solve the following problem.  An angle has a value of  \\pi \\pi /6 radians. What is the sine, cos, and tangent of the angle?  To solve this problem we need to import the  sin() ,  cos() , and  tan()  functions. It is also useful to have the value of  \\pi \\pi , rather than having to write  3.14....  We can import all of these functions at the same time using the syntax:  from module import function1, function2, function3  Note the commas in between the function names.   Try:  >>> from math import sin, cos, tan, pi\n>>> pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> sin(pi/6)\n0.49999999999999994\n>>> >>> cos(pi/6)\n0.8660254037844387\n>>> tan(pi/6)\n0.5773502691896257",

Then to use the functions, we need to use the names  statistics.mean ,  statistics.median ,  statistics.mode , and  statistics.stdev . See below:  >>> import statistics\n\n>>> test_scores = [60, 83, 83, 91, 100 ]\n\n>>> statistics.mean(test_scores)\n83.4\n\n>>> statistics.median(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> statistics.mode(test_scores)\n83\n\n>>> statistics.stdev(test_scores)\n14.842506526863986",

Recall that to define a variable in Python, the variable name is written first, then the assignment operator \n=\n followed by a value or expression.\n\n\nThe general syntax to assign a value to variable name is below:\n\n\nvariable_name = value\n````\n\nVariable names in Python must adhere to the following rules:\n\n * variable names must start with a letter\n * variable names can only contain letters, numbers and the underscore character ```_```\n * variable names can not contain spaces\n * variable names are not enclosed in quotes or brackets\n\n\nBelow is a discussion of a few different built-in data types in Python.\n### Integers\n\n_Integers_ are one of the Python data types. An integer is a whole number, negative, positive or zero. In Python, integer variables are defined by simply assigning a whole number to a variable. Python's ```type()``` function can be used to determine the data type of a variable.\n\n```python\n>>> a = 5\n>>> type(a)\n<class 'int'>\n\n\n\n\nThe output \n<class 'int'>\n indicates the variable \na\n is an integer. Integers can be negative or zero.\n\n\n>>> b = -2\n>>> type(b)\n<class 'int'>\n>>> z = 0\n>>> type(z)\n<class 'int'>\n\n\n\n\nFloating Point Numbers\n\n\nFloating point numbers or \nfloats\n are another Python data type. Floats are decimals, positive, negative and zero. Floats can also be numbers in scientific notation which contain exponents.\n\n\nBoth a lower case \ne\n or an upper case \nE\n can be used to define floats in scientific notation. In Python, a float can be defined using a decimal point \n.\n when a variable is assigned.\n\n\n>>> c = 6.2\n>>> type(c)\n<class 'float'>\n>>> d = -0.03\n>>> type(d)\n<class 'float'>\n>>> Na = 6.02e23\n>>> Na\n6.02e+23\n>>> type(Na)\n<class 'float'>\n\n\n\n\nTo define a variable as a float instead of an integer, even if the variable is assigned a whole number, a trailing decimal point \n.\n is used. Note the difference when a decimal point \n.\n comes after a whole number:\n\n\n>>> g = 5\n>>> type(g)\n<class 'int'>\n>>> g = 5.\n>>> type(g)\n<class 'float'>\n\n\n\n\nComplex Numbers\n\n\nAnother useful numeric data type for problem solvers is the \ncomplex number\n data type. A complex number is defined in Python using a real component \n+\n an imaginary component \nj\n. The letter \nj\n must be used to denote the imaginary component. Using the letter \ni\n to define a complex number in Python returns an error.

In Python, strings are indexed using square brackets \n[ ]\n. An important point to remember: \nPython counting starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n. \n\n\nConsider the word below.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nThe letter \nS\n is at the zero index, the letter \no\n is at the first index. The last letter of the word \nSolution\n is \nn\n. \nn\n is in the seventh index. Even though the word \nSolution\n has eight letters, the last letter is in the seventh index. This is because Python indexing starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n.\n\n\n\n\n>>> word = 'Solution'\n>>> word[0]\n'S'\n\n\n\n\n>>> word[1]\n'o'\n\n\n\n\n>>> word[7]\n'n'\n\n\n\n\nIf the eighth index of the word \nSolution\n is called, an error is returned.\n\n\n>>> word[8]\n\nIndexError: string index out of range\n\n\n\n\nNegative Indexing\n\n\nPlacing a negative number inside of the square brackets pulls a character out of a string starting from the end of the string.\n\n\n>>> word[-1]\n'n'\n\n\n\n\n>>> word[-2]\n'o'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString Slicing\n\n\nA colon on the inside of the square brackets between two numbers indicates \nthrough\n. If the index \n[0:3]\n is called, the characters at positions \n0\n through \n3\n are returned. Remember Python counting starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n. So \n[0:3]\n indicates the first through third letters, which are indexes \n0\n to \n2\n.\n\n\n>>> word[0:3]\n'Sol'\n\n\n\n\nA colon by itself on the inside of square brackets indicates \nall\n.\n\n\n>>> word[:]\n'Solution'\n\n\n\n\nWhen three numbers are separated by two colons inside of square brackets, the numbers represent \nstart\n : \nstop\n : \nstep\n.

There are three main types of cells: code cells, output cells, and markdown cells.\n\n\nCode Cells\n\n\nIn code cells, you can write Python code, then execute the Python code and see the resulting output. An example of a code cell is shown below. \n\n\n\n\nYou can tell you are typing in a code cell because \nIn [ ]:\n is shown to the left of the cell and the cell-type drop-down menu shows \nCode\n.\n\n\nTo run the Python code in a code cell push the [Run] button or type [Shift]+[Enter]. Hitting [Enter] when the cursor is inside a code cell brings the cursor down to a new line.\n\n\n\n\nOutput Cells\n\n\nAfter a code cell is run, an output cell can be produced below the code cell. The output cell contains the output from the code cell above it. Not all code produces output, so not all code cells produce output cells. The results in output cells can't be edited. If a code cell produces plots, charts or images, these outputs are shown in output cells. \n\n\n\n\nYou can clear all the output cells and re-run code cells by selecting \n[Kernal]\n --> \n[Restart Kernal and Clear Output]\n.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Cells\n\n\nMarkdown cells don't contain Python code. Markdown cells contain text written in Markdown format.  Text in markdown cells can be formatted to show \nbold\n or \nitalic\n text. Tables, images, and lists can also be included in markdown cells.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown cells are used for documentation and explaining your code. The text in a markdown cell is not executed. Markdown cells can be formatted with a few special characters.\n\n\nMarkdown cells are run like code cells. The difference is that when markdown cells are run, the text is formatted (when code cells run, code is executed). Markdown cells are run by clicking the [Run] button or by pressing \n[Shift]\n + \n[Enter]\n\n\nText in markdown cells can be formatted using \nmarkdown syntax\n. An example of markdown syntax is putting an underscore before and after a word to cause the word to be formatted in \nitalics\n.\n\n\nHeadings\n\n\nHeadings are created in markdown cells using the hash symbol \n#\n. One \n#\n is the largest heading. Four hashes \n####\n is the smallest heading.\n\n\n# H1 Heading\n\n\n\n\n## H2 Heading\n\n\n\n\n### H3 Heading\n\n\n\n\n#### H4 Heading\n\n\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\n\nCode blocks can be inserted in Jupyter notebook markdown cells. For inline code blocks use the ` left quote character, the character to the left of the number \n[1]``` and above ```[Tab]\n on most keyboards.\n\n\nThis is inline code:  ` ` ` Inline code block ` ` ` within a paragraph\n\n\nFor a separated code block use three ` left quote characters on one line, followed by the code block on separate lines. Terminate the separate code block with a line of three ` left quote characters.\n\n\n```\n\n\nSeparated code block\n\n\n```\n\n\nBold and italics\n\n\nBold\n and \nitalic font\n is displayed by surrounding text with a double asterisk for \n**bold**\n and a single underscore for \n_italics_\n\n\n**bold**\n produces \nbold\n\n\n_italics_\n produces \nitalics\n\n\n**_bold and italic_**\n produces \nbold and italic\n\n\nTables\n\n\nTables are displayed using the pipe \n|\n character, which is [Shift]+[\\] on most keyboards. Columns are separated by pipes \n|\n and rows are separated by lines. After the header row, a row of pipes and dashes \n---\n are needed to define the table.\n\n\n| header1 | header 2 | header 3 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |\n| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |\n\n\n\n\nproduces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheader1\n\n\nheader 2\n\n\nheader 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol 1\n\n\ncol 2\n\n\ncol 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol 1\n\n\ncol 2\n\n\ncol 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet Points and Lists\n\n\nBullet points are produced using the asterisk character \n*\n\n\n * item 1\n * item 2\n * item 3\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nitem 1\n\n\nitem 2\n\n\n\n\nNumbered lists are produced using sequential numbers followed by a dot. Indent sub-items with two spaces.\n\n\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n  1. sub item\n  2. sub item\n    1. sub-sub item\n    2. sub-sub item\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nFirst item\n\n\nSecond item\n\n\nThird item\n\n\nsub item\n\n\nsub item\n\n\nsub-sub item\n\n\nsub-sub item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal Rule\n\n\nA horizontal rule is specified with three asterisks \n***\n on a single line.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nHyperlinks are specified using a set of square brackets \n[ ]\n followed by a pair of parenthesis \n( )\n The text inside the square brackets will be the link, the link address goes in the parenthesis.\n\n\n[Python.org](https://python.org/)\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nPython.org\n\n\nImages\n\n\nImages are embedded in Jupyter Notebook markdown using the exclamation point and square brackets \n![ ]\n, followed by the image file path in parenthesis \n( )\n. If the image can not be displayed, the text in square brackets will be shown. The image can be in the same directory as the notebook, or a relative path can be specified. In this case, the image \nengineering.png\n is stored in the \nimages\n directory, which is a subdirectory of the directory the notebook is saved in.\n\n\n![Engineering Image](images/engineering.png)\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\nLaTeX Math\n\n\nLaTeX Math equations and symbols are rendered by markdown cells. A more extensive list of LaTeX commands can be found in the appendix.\n\n\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx $$\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n\n \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx \n\n\n \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{1}{x^2} dx \n\n\n\n\nhtml\n\n\nBecause Jupyter notebooks are rendered by web browsers, just about any HTML tag can be included in the markdown portion of a notebook. An example of an HTML tag is the \n<sup>\n \n</sup>\n tags that surround superscript text.\n\n\nx<sup>2</sup>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nx\n2\n\n\nText can be colored using html \n<font>\n \n</font>\n tags\n\n\n<font color=red>Red Text</font>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\nRed Text\n\n\nwarning boxes\n\n\nbootstrap style warning boxes can be included in Jupyter notebook markdown using \n<div>\n tags\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\">\n  <strong>Warning!</strong> Python lists start at 0\n</div>\n\n\n\n\nproduces\n\n\n\n  \nWarning!\n Python lists start at 0\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new cell\n\n\nYou can create a new cell in a Jupyter Notebook by clicking the [+] button in the upper menu. Clicking the [+] button produces a new code cell below the currently active cell.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create a new cell using \nInsert\n --> \nInsert Cell Above\n or \nInsert Cell Below\n. You can choose to insert a cell above or below the currently active cell.\n\n\nChanging the cell type\n\n\nThe type of cell: code cell or markdown cell, is changed by clicking on a cell and selecting the cell type from the drop-down menu. Typing \n[Esc]\n + \n[m]\n changes the cell type to a markdown cell. Typing \n[Esc]\n + \n[y]\n changes the cell type to a code cell.\n\n\n\n\nSaving a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be saved using the save icon in the upper menu or by pressing [Ctrl] + [s].\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can also be saved as a copy, similar to the Save As command common in many programs. To save a copy of a Jupyter notebook use \nFile\n --> \nMake a Copy...\n\n\n\n\nRenaming a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks are renamed by clicking on the notebook name above the upper menu and typing a new name into the dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading a Jupyter Notebook\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be downloaded and saved using \nFile --> Download As --> Notebook (.ipynb)\n. Selecting this menu option will download the notebook as a \n.ipynb\n file. \n\n\n\n\nNote that when a \n.ipynb\n file is viewed in a text editor like notepad, the notebook is unformatted and looks like a confusing jumble of text. The notebook needs to be opened in a Jupyter notebook file browser in order for the code in the notebook to run and the markdown text to render.\n\n\n\n\nSaving Jupyter Notebooks in Other Formats\n\n\nJupyter notebooks can be saved in other formats besides the native \n.ipynb\n format. These formats can be accessed using the \n[File] --> [Download As]\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe available file download types are:\n\n\n\n\nNotebook (.ipynb) - The native jupyter notebook format\n\n\nPython (.py) - The native Python code file type.\n\n\nHTML (.html) - A web page\n\n\nMarkdown (.md) - Markdown format\n\n\nreST (.rst) - Restructured text format\n\n\nLaTeX (.tex) - LaTeX Article format\n\n\nPDF via LaTeX - a pdf exported from LeTeX, requires a converter\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Notebook is saved as a \n.py\n file, all text in markdown cells is converted to comments, and any code cells stay intact as Python code.",

Reusable chunks of code are particularly relevant to document as other programmers may use the code, and you may use the code again at a different time. \n\n\nPython has a couple of different ways for programmers to add documentation. One way is to use simple comments. Comments are lines of code that do not get run by the Python interpreter. Comments are meant to be viewed by humans. In Python, comment lines start with the pound symbol \n#\n. Any line that starts with a \n#\n symbol will not be run by the Python Interpreter.\n\n\nAnother way to document code is to use \ndocstrings\n. Docstrings are comments which are surrounded with triple quotation marks and usually contain multiple lines of explanation. A function containing a docstring takes the form:\n\n\ndef function_name(arguments):\n    \"\"\"\"\n    Docstring text\n\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n    <code>\n\n    return output\n\n\n\n\n\nDoc strings are what you see when the \nhelp()\n function is called.

            "text": "It is good programming practice to document your code. Reusable chunks of code are particularly relevant to document as other programmers may use the code, and you may use the code again at a different time.   Python has a couple of different ways for programmers to add documentation. One way is to use simple comments. Comments are lines of code that do not get run by the Python interpreter. Comments are meant to be viewed by humans. In Python, comment lines start with the pound symbol  # . Any line that starts with a  #  symbol will not be run by the Python Interpreter.  Another way to document code is to use  docstrings . Docstrings are comments which are surrounded with triple quotation marks and usually contain multiple lines of explanation. A function containing a docstring takes the form:  def function_name(arguments):\n    \"\"\"\"\n    Docstring text\n\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n    <code>\n\n    return output  Doc strings are what you see when the  help()  function is called. As an example, running the  help()  function on the built-in function  sum  brings up:   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      help ( sum )           Help on built-in function sum in module builtins:\n\nsum(iterable, start=0, /)\n    Return the sum of a 'start' value (default: 0) plus an iterable of numbers\n\n    When the iterable is empty, return the start value.\n    This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may\n    reject non-numeric types.      \nWe can produce the same type of output when a user types types  help()  by adding docstrings to a function.\nLet's create a new function that converts grams (g) to kilograms (kg). Let's call our function  g2kg . The first thing to do is make sure that the name  g2kg  is not assigned to another function and is not a keyword by Python. We can check quick using Python's built-in  type()  function. We know that  sum()  is a Python function, how about  g2kg() ?    In\u00a0[2]:  \n      print ( type ( sum ))  print ( type ( g2kg ))           <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  NameError                                  Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-2-487fcfc6eb43>  in  <module> ()        1  print ( type ( sum ) )  ----> 2   print ( type ( g2kg ) )  NameError : name 'g2kg' is not defined       Since  g2kg  is not already defined in Python, we can use  g2kg  as the name of a new user-defined function. Remember the  parenthesis ,  colon , and  return  statement.   In\u00a0[3]:  \n      def   g2kg ( g ): \n     kg   =   g / 1000  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">kg</span>      \nNow let's try and use our function. How many kilograms is 1300 grams? We expect the output to be  1.3  kilograms.   In\u00a0[4]:  \n      g2kg ( 1300 )         Out[4]:   1.3      \nIf we call  help()  on our  g2kg()  function, nothing is returned.  help(g2kg)  does not return any output because our new  g2kg()  function does not contain a docstring yet.   In\u00a0[5]:  \n      help ( g2kg )           Help on function g2kg in module __main__:\n\ng2kg(g)      \nIf we insert a docstring into the function definition,  help(g2kg)  will return whatever text we included in the docstring.  The standard components of docstrings included in function definitions include:   a summary of the function  the function inputs  the function outputs  an example of the function running including the result   The docstring is included right below the  def  line and is enclosed in triple quotes  \"\"\"  \"\"\" .

Imports\n\n\nImport \nmatplot.pyplot as plt\n, as well as any other modules needed to work with the data such as NumPy or Pandas. If using a Jupyter notebook include the line \n%matplotlib inline\n in the import section.\n\n\n2. Define data\n\n\nYour plot needs to contain something. This is defined after the imports. Typically data for plots is contained in Python lists, NumPy arrays or Pandas dataframes.\n\n\n3. Plot data including options\n\n\nUse \nplt.plot()\n to plot the data defined you defined. Note the \nplt.plot()\n line needs to be called before any other plot details are specified. Otherwise the details have no plot to apply to.\n\n\nBesides the data, arguments in \nplt.plot()\n call can include:\n\n\n\n\nlinewideth= <float or int>\n\n\nlinestyle='<linestyle abbreviation>'\n\n\ncolor='<color abbreviation>'\n\n\nalpha= <float or int>\n\n\nmarker='<marker abbreviation>'\n\n\nmarkeredgecolor='<color abbreviation>'\n\n\nmarkerfacecolor='<color abbreviation>'\n\n\nmarkersize=<float or int>\n\n\n\n\n4. Add plot details\n\n\nAdd details such as a title, axis labels, legend and a grid. Plot details to add include:\n\n\n\n\nplt.title('<title string>')\n\n\nplt.xlabel('<x-axis label string>')\n\n\nplt.ylabel('<y-axis label string>')\n\n\nplt.legend(['list','of','strings'])\n\n\nptl.grid(<True or False>)\n\n\nplt.xticks([list of tick locations, floats or ints],[list of tick labels, strings]\n\n\nplt.yticks([list of tick locations, floats or ints],[list of tick labels, strings]\n\n\n\n\n5.

It is a standard convention to import Matplotlib's  pyplot  library as  plt . The  plt  alias will be familiar to other Python programmers.  If using a Jupyter notebook include the line  %matplotlib inline  after the imports.  %matplotlib inline  is a Jupyter notebook magic command which causes Matplotlib plots to display directly inside Jupyter notebook output cells.   We will also use NumPy, a numerical computing library for Python, to build the plot. NumPy is typically imported with the alias  np .   In\u00a0[5]:  \n      import   matplotlib.pyplot   as   plt  import   numpy   as   np  # include if using a Jupyter notebook  % matplotlib  inline     \nNumPy's  arange()  function creates an array of numbers with the parameters  arange(start,stop,step) .

This section builds upon the work in the previous section where a plot with one line was created. This section also introduces Matplotlib's object-oriented approach to building plots. The object-oriented approach to building plots will be used in the rest of this chapter.\n\n\nThe Matplotlib's object-oriented interface\n\n\nAn object-oriented plotting interface is an interface where components of the plot (like the axis, title, lines, markers, etc.) are treated as programmatic \nobjects\n that have \nattributes\n and \nmethods\n associated with them. To create a new \nobject\n is called \ninstantiation\n. Once an object is created, or \ninstantiated\n, the properties of that object can be modified, and methods can be called on the object. The basic anatomy of a Matplotlib plot includes a couple of layers, each of these layers is a programming \nobject\n:\n\n\n\n\nFigure Objects: The bottom layer. Think of the figure layer as the figure window which contains the minimize, maximize, close buttons. A figure can include one plot or multiple plots\n\n\nPlot Objects: A plot builds on the Figure layer. If there are multiple plots, each plot is called a subplot. \n\n\nAxis Objects: An axis is added to a Plot layer. Axis can be thought of as sets of x and y axis that lines and bars are drawn on. An Axis contains daughter attributes like axis labels, tick labels, and line thickness.\n\n\nData Objects: data points, lines, shapes are plotted on an axis\n\n\n\n\nThe Matplotlib's object-oriented interface\n\n\nAn object-oriented plotting interface is an interface where components of the plot (like the axis, title, lines, markers, etc.) are treated as programmatic \nobjects\n that have \nattributes\n and \nmethods\n associated with them.

An Axis contains daughter attributes like axis labels, tick labels, and line thickness.\n\n\nData Objects: data points, lines, shapes are plotted on an axis\n\n\n\n\nTo build a figure object,  Matplotlib's \nplt.subplot()\n function is used. The \nplt.subplot()\n function creates both a figure \nobject\n and an axis \nobject\n. We say the \nplt.subplot()\n function \ninstantiates\n a figure \nobject\n and \ninstantiates\n an axis object. For now, we'll leave the \nsubplot()\n arguments blank. By default, the \nsubplot()\n function creates a single figure object and a single axis object.  We'll call the figure object \nfig\n and the axis object \nax\n. Note these two outputs of the \nplt.subplots()\n function are separated by a comma.\n\n\nWe have a figure object and axis object, but both of these objects are without attributes. We add elements to the axis object to build a plot.

A color scale is typically represented besides a plot. Color bars are added to Matplotlib contour plots using the \nfig.colorbar()\n method. Since the color bar is not part of the contour plot, the color bar needs to be applied to the figure object, often called \nfig\n. A contour plot needs to be passed into the \nfig.colorbar()\n method. Therefore, when you add a color bar to a figure, a plot object needs to be available. A plot object is the output of the \nax.contour()\n method. Previously, the output of the \nax.contour()\n method was not assigned to a variable. But to include a color bar on a contour plot, the plot object needs to be saved to a variable so that it can be passed to the \nfig.colorbar()\n method.\n\n\ncf = ax1.contourf(X,Y,Z)\nfig.colorbar(cf, ax=ax1)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \ncf\n is the plot object created by \nax1.contourf(X, Y, Z)\n. The axis object that contains the contour plot, \nax1\n is passed to the \nfig.colorbar()\n method along with the \ncf\n plot object.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[4]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n-\n3.0\n,\n \n3.0\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n-\n3.0\n,\n \n3.0\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\nX\n,\n \nY\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nmeshgrid\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n)\n\n\nZ\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nsin\n(\nX\n)\n*\nnp\n.\ncos\n(\nY\n)\n\n\nfig\n,\n \nax1\n \n=\n \nplt\n.\nsubplots\n(\nfigsize\n=\n(\n6\n,\n6\n))\n\n\nax1\n.\nset_aspect\n(\n'equal'\n)\n\n\ncf\n \n=\n \nax1\n.\ncontourf\n(\nX\n,\nY\n,\nZ\n)\n\n\nfig\n.\ncolorbar\n(\ncf\n,\n \nax\n=\nax1\n)\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor maps on contour plots\n\n\nThe default color scheme of Matplotlib contour and filled contour plots can be modified. A general way to do this is to call Matplotlib's \nplt.get_cmap()\n function which outputs a color map object. There are many different colormaps available to apply to contour plots. A complete list is available in the Matplotlib documentation. The colormap object is then passed to the \nax.contourf()\n or \nax.contour()\n method as a keyword argument.\n\n\nmycmap = plt.get_cmap('gist_earth')\nax.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap=mycmap)\n\n\n\n\nThe code section below produces two filled contour plots, each with a different color map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[4]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nmatplotlib.pyplot\n \nas\n \nplt\n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\n# if using a Jupyter notebook, include:\n\n\n%\nmatplotlib\n inline\n\n\nx\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n-\n3.0\n,\n \n3.0\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\ny\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\narange\n(\n-\n3.0\n,\n \n3.0\n,\n \n0.1\n)\n\n\n\nX\n,\n \nY\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nmeshgrid\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n)\n\n\n\nZ\n \n=\n \nnp\n.\nsin\n(\nX\n)\n*\nnp\n.\ncos\n(\nY\n)\n\n\n\nfig\n,\n \n[\nax1\n,\nax2\n]\n \n=\n \nplt\n.\nsubplots\n(\n1\n,\n2\n,\nfigsize\n=\n(\n12\n,\n6\n))\n\n\n\nmycmap1\n \n=\n \nplt\n.\nget_cmap\n(\n'gist_earth'\n)\n\n\nax1\n.\nset_aspect\n(\n'equal'\n)\n\n\nax1\n.\nset_title\n(\n'Colormap: gist_earth'\n)\n\n\ncf1\n \n=\n \nax1\n.\ncontourf\n(\nX\n,\nY\n,\nZ\n,\n \ncmap\n=\nmycmap1\n)\n\n\n\nfig\n.\ncolorbar\n(\ncf1\n,\n \nax\n=\nax1\n)\n\n\n\nmycmap2\n \n=\n \nplt\n.\nget_cmap\n(\n'gnuplot2'\n)\n\n\nax2\n.\nset_aspect\n(\n'equal'\n)\n\n\nax2\n.\nset_title\n(\n'Colormap: gnuplot2'\n)\n\n\ncf2\n \n=\n \nax2\n.\ncontourf\n(\nX\n,\nY\n,\nZ\n,\n \ncmap\n=\nmycmap2\n)\n\n\n\nfig\n.\ncolorbar\n(\ncf2\n,\n \nax\n=\nax2\n)\n\n\n\nplt\n.\nshow\n()",

Also, note how the code below each if-statement is indented. With the code left-justified (not indented), all three code lines will run, and the output will be different. The  pass  keyword is used as the code will not run unless at least one line of code is indented after the if-statement.  pass  is a line of code that does nothing in Python.   In\u00a0[3]:  \n      a   =   2  if   a < 0 : \n     pass  print ( 'a is negative' )  if   a   ==   0 : \n     pass  print ( 'a is zero' )  if   a > 0 : \n     pass  print ( 'a is positive' )           a is negative\na is zero\na is positive",

If the line  a = 5  and  print(a[0])  throws an exception error, the code below  except  runs.

This section describes for loops.\n\n\nFor Loops\n are a component of many programming languages. A \nFor Loop\n is a repetition structure where a section of code runs a specified number of times. \n\n\nSay we want to print out the statements:\n\n\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\n\n\n\n\nOne way to accomplish this task is by coding three print statements in a row:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nprint\n(\n'Problem solving in teams'\n)\n\n\nprint\n(\n'Problem solving in teams'\n)\n\n\nprint\n(\n'Problem solving in teams'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to accomplish the same task is to use a for loop. The basic structure of a for loop in Python is below:\n\n\nfor <var> in range(<num>):\n    <code>\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n<var>\n can be any variable, \nrange(<num>)\n is the number of times the for loop runs and \n<code>\n are the lines of code that execute each time the for loop runs. Note the for loop starts with the keyword \nfor\n and includes a colon \n:\n. Both \nfor\n and the colon \n:\n are required. Also, note \n<code>\n is indented. Each line of code that runs as part of the for loop needs to be indented the same number of spaces. Standard indentation in Python is four spaces. \n\n\nThe example above can be rewritten using a for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n3\n):\n\n    \nprint\n(\n'Problem solving in teams'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange()\n function\n\n\nPython's \nrange()\n function returns an iterable list of values starting at zero and ending at \nn-1\n. For example, when \nrange(3)\n is called, the values \n0, 1, 2\n are returned. Note \n3\n is not part of the output, even though the function input was \nrange(3)\n. We can be confirm the behavior of \nrange()\n with a for loop:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n3\n):\n\n    \nprint\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing \nrange()\n\n\nPython's \nrange()\n function can be customized by supplying up to three arguments. The general format of the range function is below:\n\n\nrange(start,stop,step)\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nrange(3)\n is called, it produces the same output as \nrange(0,3,1)\n (\nstart=0\n,\nstop=3\n,\nstep=1\n). Remember Python counting starts at \n0\n and ends at \nn-1\n. If only two arguments are supplied, as in \nrange(0,3)\n, a \nstep=1\n is assumed.\n\n\nThe table below includes examples of the Python's \nrange()\n function and the associated output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange()\n function\n\n\noutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(3)\n\n\n0, 1, 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(0,3)\n\n\n0, 1, 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(0,3,1)\n\n\n0, 1, 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(2,7,2)\n\n\n2, 4, 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(0,-5,-1)\n\n\n0, -1, -2, -3, -4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrange(2,-3,1)\n\n\n(no output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA code section that uses a for loop and \nrange()\n with three arguments is below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[4]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n5\n,\n9\n,\n1\n):\n\n    \nprint\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor loops with lists\n\n\nFor loops can also be run using lists. If a list is used, the loop will run as many times as there are items in the list. The general syntax is:\n\n\nfor <var> in <list>:\n    <code>\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n<var>\n is a variable name assigned to the item in the list and \n<list>\n is the list object. Remember to include a colon \n:\n after the list.  \n<code>\n is the programming code that runs for each item in the list. \n\n\nAn example of a list in a for loop is  below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[5]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nmy_list\n \n=\n \n[\n'electrical'\n,\n'civil'\n,\n'mechanical'\n]\n\n\nfor\n \nitem\n \nin\n \nmy_list\n:\n\n    \nprint\n(\nitem\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelectrical\ncivil\nmechanical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loop ran three times because there are three items in the list.

            "text": "In this chapter, you will learn about two kinds of repetition structures in Python:  for loops  and  while loops . This section describes for loops.  For Loops  are a component of many programming languages. A  For Loop  is a repetition structure where a section of code runs a specified number of times.   Say we want to print out the statements:  Problem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams  One way to accomplish this task is by coding three print statements in a row:   In\u00a0[1]:  \n      print ( 'Problem solving in teams' )  print ( 'Problem solving in teams' )  print ( 'Problem solving in teams' )           Problem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams      \nAnother way to accomplish the same task is to use a for loop. The basic structure of a for loop in Python is below:  for <var> in range(<num>):\n    <code>  Where  <var>  can be any variable,  range(<num>)  is the number of times the for loop runs and  <code>  are the lines of code that execute each time the for loop runs. Note the for loop starts with the keyword  for  and includes a colon  : . Both  for  and the colon  :  are required. Also, note  <code>  is indented. Each line of code that runs as part of the for loop needs to be indented the same number of spaces. Standard indentation in Python is four spaces.   The example above can be rewritten using a for loop:   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      for   i   in   range ( 3 ): \n     print ( 'Problem solving in teams' )           Problem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams\nProblem solving in teams",

The data types stored in a Python list can all be different.\n\n\npython_list =[ 1, -0.038, 'gear', True]\n\n\n\n\nThe Python list above contains four different data types: \n1\n is an integer, \n-0.038\n is a float, \n'gear'\n is a string, and \n'True'\n is a boolean.\n\n\nThe code below prints the data type of each value store in \npython_list\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[1]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\npython_list\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n-\n0.038\n,\n \n'gear'\n,\n \nTrue\n]\n\n\nfor\n \nitem\n \nin\n \npython_list\n:\n\n    \nprint\n(\ntype\n(\nitem\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<class 'int'>\n<class 'float'>\n<class 'str'>\n<class 'bool'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values stored in a NumPy array must all share the same data type. Consider the NumPy array below:\n\n\nnp.array([1.0, 3.1, 5e-04, 0.007])\n\n\n\n\nAll four values stored in the NumPy array above share the same data type: \n1.0\n, \n3.1\n, \n5e-04\n, and \n0.007\n are all floats.\n\n\nThe code below prints the data type of each value stored in the NumPy array above.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[2]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nimport\n \nnumpy\n \nas\n \nnp\n\n\nnp_array\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n-\n0.038\n,\n \n'gear'\n,\n \nTrue\n]\n\n\nfor\n \nvalue\n \nin\n \nnp\n.\narray\n([\n1.0\n,\n \n3.1\n,\n \n5e-04\n,\n \n0.007\n]):\n\n    \nprint\n(\ntype\n(\nvalue\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n<class 'numpy.float64'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the same four elements stored in the previous Python list are stored in a NumPy array, NumPy forces all of the four items in the list to conform to the same data type. \n\n\nIn the next code section, all four items are converted to type \n'<U32'\n, which is a string data type in NumPy (the \nU\n refers Unicode strings; all strings in Python are Unicode by default).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nnp\n.\narray\n([\n1\n,\n \n-\n0.038\n,\n \n'gear'\n,\n \nTrue\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[3]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray(['1', '-0.038', 'gear', 'True'], dtype='<U32')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumPy arrays can also be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or up to n-dimensional. Computer resources limit array size, but the data type stored in each array is limited to the same type.\nNumPy arrays are useful because mathematical operations can be run on an entire array simultaneously. If a numbers are stored in a regular Python list, when the list is multiplied by a scalar, the list extends and repeats- instead of multiplying each number in the list by the scalar.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[4]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nlst\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n]\n\n\nlst\n*\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[4]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo multiply each element of a Python list by the scalar number \n2\n, a loop can be used:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0[5]:\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nlst\n \n=\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n]\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n,\n \nitem\n \nin\n \nenumerate\n(\nlst\n):\n\n    \nlst\n[\ni\n]\n \n=\n \nlst\n[\ni\n]\n*\n2\n\n\nlst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[5]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method above is relatively cumbersome and is also quite \ncomputationally expensive\n. An operation that is computationally expensive is an operation that takes a lot of processing time or storage resources like RAM or CPU bandwidth.\n\n\nAnother way of completing the same action as the loop above is to use a NumPy array. \n\n\nAn entire NumPy array can be multiplied by a scalar in one step.

In\u00a0[1]:  \n      import   numpy   as   np  A   =   np . array ([[ 8 ,   3 ,   - 2 ],   [ - 4 ,   7 ,   5 ],   [ 3 ,   4 ,   - 12 ]])  b   =   np . array ([ 9 ,   15 ,   35 ])  x   =   np . linalg . solve ( A ,   b )  x         Out[1]:   array([-0.58226371,  3.22870478, -1.98599767])      \nWe can plug the valuse of  x x ,  y y  and  z z  back into one of the equations to check the answer.   x x  is the first entry of the array,  y y  is the second entry of the array, and  z z  is the third entry of the array.  x x  =  x[0]  y y  =  x[1]  z z  =  x[2]  When these values are plugged into the equation from above:    8x + 3y -2z = 9    8x + 3y -2z = 9    The answer should be  9.0 .   In\u00a0[2]:  \n      8     x [ 0 ]   +   3     x [ 1 ]   -   2   *   x [ 2 ]         Out[2]:   9.0",

In\u00a0[8]:  \n      eq1 = Eq ( Tce np . cos ( np . radians ( 30 ))   -   Tbd np . cos ( np . radians ( 45 )))  print ( eq1 )           Eq(-0.707106781186548*Tbd + 0.866025403784439*Tce, 0)      \nThe second equation, based on the sum of the forces in the y-direction is:    T_{ce} sin(30) + T_{bd} sin(45) - 22 = 0    T_{ce} sin(30) + T_{bd} sin(45) - 22 = 0    Define this equation as a SymPy equation object as well:   In\u00a0[9]:  \n      eq2 = Eq ( Tce np . sin ( np . radians ( 30 ))   +   Tbd np . sin ( np . radians ( 45 )) - 22 )  print ( eq2 )           Eq(0.707106781186547*Tbd + 0.5*Tce - 22, 0)      \nNow solve the two equations for  T_{ce} T_{ce}  and  T_{bd} T_{bd}  with SymPy's  solve()  method. The first argument passed to the  solve()  method is a tuple of equations to solve, the argument passed to the  solve()  method is a tuple of the variables to solve for.   In\u00a0[10]:  \n      solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce ,   Tbd ))         Out[10]:   {Tce: 16.1051177665153, Tbd: 19.7246603876972}      \nThe solution is saved in a Python dictionary. The dictionary keys are the variable names and the dictionary values are the numerical solutions.   The numerical solutions can be pulled out of the dictionary using regular Python dictionary access. Note  Tce  and  Tbd  are SymPy symbols objects, not strings.   In\u00a0[11]:  \n      sol_dict   =   solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce ,   Tbd ))  print ( f 'Tce =  {sol_dict[Tce]} ' )  print ( f 'Tce =  {sol_dict[Tbd]} ' )           Tce = 16.1051177665153\nTce = 19.7246603876972      \nThe same problem can be solved again, but with  w w  kept as a variable.   In\u00a0[12]:  \n      w ,   Tce ,   Tbd   =   symbols ( 'w, Tab, Tac' )  eq1 = Eq ( Tce np . cos ( np . radians ( 30 ))   -   Tbd np . cos ( np . radians ( 45 )))  eq2 = Eq ( Tce np . sin ( np . radians ( 30 ))   +   Tbd np . sin ( np . radians ( 45 )) - w )  solve (( eq1 , eq2 ),( Tce , Tbd ))         Out[12]:   {Tab: 0.732050807568878*w, Tac: 0.896575472168054*w}      \nThe result is a solution is in terms of the variable  w w .",

To accomplish this task, the following hardware is required:\n\n\n\n\nA computer running Python\n\n\nAn Arduino\n\n\nAn LED\n\n\nWires, a resistor and a breadboard to connect the LED to the Arduino\n\n\nA USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer\nYou will also need to download the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Download the Arduino IDE using the following link: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\n\n\n\n\nIf you are working on a computer that you don't have administrator privileges to install software on, be sure to select: [Windows ZIP for non-admin install].\n\n\n\n\nWire the LED to the Arduino\n\n\nConnect the LED to the Arduino using a resistor, wires and a breadboard. Note the short leg of the LED is connected to ground, and the long leg of the resistor is connected through a resistor to PIN 13. A resistor is needed to prevent too much current from flowing through the LED. This type of resistor is called a \npull up resistor\n.\n\n\n\nUpload code to the Arduino\n\n\nUpload the following code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE. The code is same as in the example sketch called \nPhysical Pixel\n. The \nPhysical Pixel\n sketch is found in the Arduino IDE under File --> Examples --> 04.Communication --> PhysicalPixel\n\n\n\n\nThe code for the Physical Pixel Sketch is shown below.\n\n\n// Arduino IDE: \n// File -> Examples -> 04.Communication -> PhysicalPixel\n\nconst int ledPin = 13; // pin the LED is attached to\nint incomingByte;      // variable stores  serial data\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // initialize serial communication:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  // initialize the LED pin as an output:\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // see if there's incoming serial data:\n  if (Serial.available() > 0) {\n    // read the oldest byte in the serial buffer:\n    incomingByte = Serial.read();\n    // if it's a capital H (ASCII 72), turn on the LED:\n    if (incomingByte == 'H') {\n      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);\n    }\n    // if it's an L (ASCII 76) turn off the LED:\n    if (incomingByte == 'L') {\n      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the Computer\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the computer using a USB cable. Ensure two settings in the Arduino IDE are set correctly.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the \nPort\n is selected properly in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Port. \n\n\nMake sure the \nBoard\n is selected in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Board --> Arduino/Genuino Uno\n\n\n\n\nIn the Arduino IDE, click the [checkmark] to verify and the [arrow] to upload. If the sketch does not upload, check which COM port is selected in Tools --> Port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn the LED on and off with the Arduino Serial Monitor\n\n\nOpen the Arduino Serial Monitor using Tools --> Serial Monitor. In the Serial Monitor type \nL\n or \nH\n and click [Send]. Observe the LED turn on and off. Send \nH\n to turn the LED on. Send \nL\n to turn the LED off.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Python REPL to turn the Arduino LED on and off\n\n\nNext,  use the Python REPL to turn the Arduino on and off. (You can open the Python REPL by typing \n> python\n at the \nAnaconda Prompt\n) At the Python REPL, type the following commands. If a REPL prompt \n>>>\n precedes the command, type the command into the REPL. If the line does not start with a REPL prompt, the line represents expected output. \n\n\nWhen you type the command: \nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9800, timeout=1)\n, ensure the \n'COM#'\n corresponds to the port that worked with the Arduino IDE in Tools --> Port.\n\n\n>>> import serial\n>>> import time\n\n>>> ser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9600)  # open serial port\n>>> time.sleep(2)                      # wait 2 seconds\n>>> ser.name()\n'COM4'\n\n>>> ser.write(b'H')\n# LED turns on\n\n>>> ser.write(b'L')\n# LED turns off\n\n>>> ser.write(b'H')\n# LED turns on\n\n>>> ser.write(b'L')\n# LED turns off\n\n>>> ser.close()\n>>> exit()\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the command \nser.close()\n is issued before exiting the Python REPL. \n\n\nWrite a Python Script to turn the LED on and off\n\n\nAfter the LED turns on and off based on sending \nH\n and \nL\n with the Arduino Serial Monitor and you can turn the LED on and off with the Python REPL, it's time to write a Python script to turn the LED on and off. Again, the serial communication between the Python script and the Arduino is facilitated by the PySerial package. Ensure PySerial is installed before running the Python script. \n\n\nAt the top of the Python script, import the PySerial package. Note that even though the package is called PySerial, the line \nimport serial\n is used. Python's built-in \ntime\n module is also imported as the \ntime.sleep()\n function will be used in the script.\n\n\n# blink.py\n\nimport serial\nimport time\n\n\n\n\nIn the next part of the Python script, connect to the Arduino over the serial port. In the line \nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9800, timeout=1)\n, ensure the \n'COM#'\n corresponds to the port that worked with the Arduino IDE. Then create a loop that blinks the Arduino LED on and off for about 5 seconds.  Notice the byte string \nb'H'\n is sent to the Arduino, not the Unicode string \n'H'\n. The Unicode string \n'H'\n is prepended with the letter \nb\n in the line \nser.writelines(b'H')\n. This line of code turns the Unicode string into a byte string before it is sent to the Arduino.\n\n\nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9800, timeout=1)\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    ser.writelines(b'H')   # send a byte\n    time.sleep(0.5)        # wait 0.5 seconds\n    ser.writelines(b'L')   # send a byte\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nser.close()\n\n\n\n\nRun the entire Python script and watch the Arduino LED blink ten times. A common problem is the serial port was not closed before the script starts. Make sure the Arduino Serial Monitor is closed and try running \n>>> ser.close()\n at the Python REPL.\n\n\nWrite a Python script to allow a user to turn the LED on and off\n\n\nOnce the LED blinks on and off successfully using a for loop in a Python script, you can write a new Python script that allows a user to turn the LED on and off. At the top of the new Python script import the \nPySerial\n package and built-in \ntime\n module.\n\n\nimport serial\nimport time\n\n\n\n\nNext, give the user instructions. If the user types \nH\n, the LED turns on. If the user types \nL\n the LED turns off. If the user types \nq\n, the program terminates.\n\n\nprint('This is a program that allows a user to turn an LED on and off')\nprint('type H to turn the LED on')\nprint('type L to turn the LED off')\nprint('type q to quit')\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the script needs a while loop to ask the user to enter the letter \nH\n, \nL\n or \nq\n. Once the user enters the letter, the letter is converted to a byte string. Next, the byte string is sent over the serial line to the Arduino. A delay is added so that the Arduino can process the command before reading with the next one.\n\n\nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9800, timeout=1)\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nuser_input = 'L'\nwhile user_input != 'q':\n    user_input = input('H = on, L = off, q = quit' : )\n    byte_command = encode(user_input)\n    ser.writelines(byte_command)   # send a byte\n    time.sleep(0.5) # wait 0.5 seconds\n\nprint('q entered. Exiting the program')\nser.close()\n\n\n\n\nRun the Python script. Type \nH\n and \nL\n and observe the LED turn on and off. Type \nq\n to end the program.",

To accomplish this, the following hardware is required:\n\n\n\n\nA computer running Python\n\n\nAn Arduino\n\n\nA potentiometer (the sensor)\n\n\nwires, a resistor, an LED, and a breadboard to connect the sensor to the Arduino\n\n\nA USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer\n\n\n\n\nYou will also need to download the Arduino IDE (the Arduino Integrated Development Environment) using the following link as shown in the previous section: \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\n\n\n\n\nWire the sensor to the Arduino\n\n\nConnect the potentiometer sensor to the Arduino using a resistor, wires and a breadboard. The middle pin of the potentiometer is connected to pin A0 on the Arduino (green wire). Connect the LED to the Arduino. Note the long lead of the LED is connected to PIN13 on the Arduino (yellow wire) and the short lead of the LED is connected through a resistor to ground (black wire). If the LED is wired backward, the LED will not turn on.\n\n\nIn the hardware schematic, the blue square with an arrow on it is a potentiometer. , and the user knows when the sensor signal changes because the user has turned the potentiometer dial.\n\n\nThe hardware schematic describes how to the Arduino, LED, resistor, and potentiometer are connected with jumper wires and a breadboard.\n\n\n\nUpload code to the Arduino\n\n\nOnce the LED and potentiometer are hooked up the Arduino, upload the following code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE. Note that Arduinos don't use the Python programming language. The programming language used by Arduinos is a variant of the C programming language.\n\n\nThe Arduino sketch below (an Arduino program is called a sketch) accomplishes a couple things. First, the Arduino reads the potentiometer sensor value and stores the sensor value in the variable \nsensorValue\n. Next, the Arduino sends the sensor value over the serial line (as a byte string). Finally, \nsensorValue\n is compared to \n500\n. If \nsensorValue\n is less than \n500\n, the LED stays off. If \nsensorValue\n is greater than \n500\n, the LED turn on. The read-send-compare process repeats in a loop.\n\n\n// potentiometer_read.ino\n// reads a potentiometer and sends value over serial\nint sensorPin = A0;  // The potentiometer on pin 0                  \nint ledPin = 13;     // The LED is connected on pin 13\nint sensorValue;     // variable to stores data\n\nvoid setup() // runs once when the sketch starts\n{\n  // make the LED pin (pin 13) an output pin\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n\n  // initialize serial communication\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n}\n\nvoid loop() // runs repeatedly after setup() finishes\n{\n  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);  // read pin A0   \n  Serial.println(sensorValue);         // send data to serial\n\n  if (sensorValue < 500) {            // less than 500?\n    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); }     // Turn the LED off\n\n  else {                               // if sensor reading is greater than 500\n    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); }     // Keep the LED on\n\n  delay(100);             // Pause 100 milliseconds before next sensor reading\n}\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the computer and Upload the Sketch\n\n\nConnect the Arduino to the computer with a USB cable. In the Arduino IDE select Tools --> Board --> Arduino/Genuino Uno. Upload the sketch to the Arduino. In the Arduino IDE, click the [check mark] to verify and the [arrow] to upload. If the sketch does not upload, check which \nCOM port\n is selected in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Ports.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Sensor Signal\n\n\nTo verify the Arduino sketch is working correctly, the sensor signal can be checked in three ways:\n\n\n\n\nThe LED turns on and off as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\nIn the Arudino \nSerial Monitor\n, numbers change as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\nIn the Arduino \nSeral Plotter\n, the line moves as the potentiometer dial is rotated\n\n\n\n\nLED turns ON and OFF\n\n\nThe LED should turn on and off as the potentiometer is rotated. If the LED does not turn on and off when the potentiometer is rotated, make sure the potentiometer is turned back and forth through it's full range of rotation. Also, ensure the USB cable is plugged into both the Arduino and the computer.\n\n\nArudino Serial Monitor\n\n\nAccess the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n using Tools --> Serial Monitor. \n\n\n\nIf the Arduino sketch is working correctly, a running list of numbers is shown in the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n. When the potentiometer is dialed back and forth, the numbers streaming down the \nSerial Monitor\n should change. The output in the Serial Monitor should be a running list of numbers between \n0\n and \n1024\n.\n\n\nIf a running list of numbers can't be seen in the Arduino \nSerial Monitor\n, ensure [Auto Scroll], [Both NL & CR] and [9600 baud] are selected. Also, make sure the \nPort\n is set correctly in the Arduino IDE under Tools --> Port. \n\n\n\n\nArduino Serial Plotter\n\n\nTo access the Arduino Serial Plotter, select Tools --> Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. Note the Arduino Serial Monitor needs to be closed before the Arduino Serial Plotter can be opened. If the sketch is working correctly, potentiometer rotation produces a moving line on the Arduino Serial Plotter. \n\n\n\n\nThe output of the Arduino Serial Plotter should be a running line graph. The height of the line on the graph should change as the potentiometer is dialed back and forth. If the Arduino Serial Plotter is blank, make sure [9600 baud] is selected in the lower right corner of the Serial Plotter. Also, make sure the \nPort\n has been set correctly in the Arduino IDE in Tools --> Port.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Python REPL to read the potentiometer data\n\n\nAt the Python REPL, type the following commands. If the REPL prompt \n>>>\n precedes the command, type the command into the REPL. If the line does not start with a REPL prompt, this line represents expected output.\n\n\n# serial read using the Python REPL\n\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import serial\n>>> import time\n>>> ser = serial.Serial('COM4',9600)\n>>> time.sleep(2)\n>>> b = ser.readline()\n>>> b\nb'409\\r\\n'\n>>> type(b)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> str_rn = b.decode()\n>>> str_rn\n'409\\r\\n'\n>>> str = str_rn.rstrip()\n>>> str\n'409'\n>>> type(str)\n<class 'str'>\n>>> f = float(str)\n>>> f\n409.0\n>>> type(f)\n<class 'float'>\n>>> ser.close()\n>>> exit()\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a Python script to read the sensor\n\n\nAfter the hardware is connected and the Arduino sketch is working correctly, you can construct a Python script to read the sensor value.\n\n\nCommunication between the Python script and the Arduino is accomplished using the PySerial package. Make sure PySerial is installed before the script is run.  See a previous section in this chapter on how to install the PySerial package.\n\n\nAt the top of the Python script, import the PySerial module. Note that although the package is called PySerial, use the line \nimport serial\n to import the package.\n\n\nimport serial\nimport time\n\n\n\n\nNext, set up the serial communication line with the Arduino. Ensure the port specified in the command \nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9600)\n is the same \nCOM#\n that was used in the Arduino IDE.\n\n\n# set up the serial line\nser = serial.Serial('COM4', 9600)\ntime.sleep(2)\n\n\n\n\nNext, code a loop runs for about 5 seconds while data is collected from the sensor.

Examples of microcontrollers that Micropython can run on includes the \npyboard\n, the \nWiPy\n and ESP8266-based boards like the \nAdafruit Feather Huzzah\n and ESP8266 NodeMCU.  \n\n\nTraditionally, Python runs on desktop or laptop computers and cloud servers. Compared to a desktop or laptop, microcontrollers are much smaller, cheaper and less powerful.  A \"regular\" version of Python can't run on small, cheap microcontrollers because Python is too resource intensive. Regular Python takes up too much hard disk space, runs on too much RAM and requires a more powerful processor than microcontrollers have. \n\n\nIt is pretty amazing that a version of Python (MicroPython) runs on these small, cheap microcontrollers like the ESP8266. To get MicroPython to run at all on these little low-cost boards, MicroPython only contains a subset of all the Standard Library modules included with \"regular\" Python. Some of the libraries that are included with MicroPython don't have the full set of functions and classes that come with the full version of Python. By not including the full functionality of \"regular\" Python, MicroPython is compact (around 600 kB for the ESP8266 port), and MicroPython only uses a small amount of RAM (down to 16k according to the \nMicropython main page\n.)\n\n\nYou can try using MicroPython online with a browser-based \nMicroPython online emulator\n. The emulator allows you to run commands at a MicroPython Prompt and see the result on a virtual pyboard. \n\n\nWhat is MicroPython used for?\n\n\nMicroPython can be installed on small, cheap microcontrollers like the \nESP8266\n. Anything these small microcontrollers can do, MicroPython can do. A microcontroller running MicroPython can read a remote sensor to measure things like temperature, humidity and light level. MicroPython can also be used to blink LED's, control arrays of LED's, or run small displays. MicroPython can control servo motors, stepper motors, and solenoids. Civil Engineers could use MicroPython to monitor water levels. Mechanical Engineers could use MicroPython to drive robots. Electrical Engineers could use MicroPython to measure voltage levels in embedded systems. \n\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will learn how to use MicroPython, running on a small cheap ESP8266 board, to turn on and off a light and read a sensor.\n\n\nWhy should problem solvers learn MircoPython?\n\n\nPython is used to solve problems such as calculations, statistics, modeling, and visualization. But Python on its own is relatively limited in controlling devices outside the computer it's running on. You don't want to leave a laptop in a remote estuary to measure water temperature, but you could leave a little microcontroller and low-cost temperature sensor in a remote location. A small robot can't carry around a heavy laptop, but a small, light, low-power board could run a simple robot. You don't want to use a computer for every small electrical measurement or embedded system control, but a $2 WiFi module would work. \n\n\nBesides, learning how to use MicroPython on small, cheap microcontroller can help problem solvers understand how programming works. Seeing and controlling a motor whirl is a different kind of feedback and excitement compared to seeing text on a screen that shows how fast a motor spins. Seeing an array of LED's light up produces a different kind of wonder compared to seeing a 2-D plot on a computer screen. Plus MicroPython is fun! It's as easy to program MicroPython as it is to program regular Python. The little projects you can do with MicroPython running on a small, low-cost board are almost unlimited. We could send MicroPython to space in a micro-satellite, or bury MicroPython underground in a boring machine, or launch MicroPython into the sky on a weather balloon.",

You can try using MicroPython online with a browser-based  MicroPython online emulator . The emulator allows you to run commands at a MicroPython Prompt and see the result on a virtual pyboard.",

Civil Engineers could use MicroPython to monitor water levels. Mechanical Engineers could use MicroPython to drive robots.

But Python on its own is relatively limited in controlling devices outside the computer it's running on. You don't want to leave a laptop in a remote estuary to measure water temperature, but you could leave a little microcontroller and low-cost temperature sensor in a remote location. A small robot can't carry around a heavy laptop, but a small, light, low-power board could run a simple robot. You don't want to use a computer for every small electrical measurement or embedded system control, but a $2 WiFi module would work.   Besides, learning how to use MicroPython on small, cheap microcontroller can help problem solvers understand how programming works. Seeing and controlling a motor whirl is a different kind of feedback and excitement compared to seeing text on a screen that shows how fast a motor spins. Seeing an array of LED's light up produces a different kind of wonder compared to seeing a 2-D plot on a computer screen. Plus MicroPython is fun! It's as easy to program MicroPython as it is to program regular Python. The little projects you can do with MicroPython running on a small, low-cost board are almost unlimited. We could send MicroPython to space in a micro-satellite, or bury MicroPython underground in a boring machine, or launch MicroPython into the sky on a weather balloon.",

In this section, you will learn how to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller such as the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 and the ESP8266 NodeMCU using Python and a package called \nesptool\n.

Install the \nAnaconda distribution\n of Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new conda environment and \npip install esptool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Download the \nlatest MicroPython .bin firmware file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Install the \nSiLabs driver\n for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Connect the ESP8266-based microcontroller board to the laptop using a micro USB cable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Determine which serial port the microcontroller is connected to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Run the \nesptool\n to upload the \n.bin\n firmware file to the microcontroller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Download and install \nPuTTY\n, a serial monitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Use PuTTY to connect to the microcontroller and run commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Install the Anaconda distribution of Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have the Anaconda distribution of Python installed already, go to \nAnaconda.com/download\n to download and install the latest version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Create a new conda environment and install \nesptool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo install MicroPython on the ESP8266-based microcontroller, we will start by creating a \nvirtual environment\n. A virtual environment is an isolated Python interpreter and a set of packages that are separate from the base version of Python running on your computer. We'll create a new virtual environment with the \nAnaconda Prompt\n and the conda command line tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the \nAnaconda Prompt\n and create a new virtual environment named \nmicropython\n. Activate the environment with the command \nconda activate\n. After activating the virtual environment, you should see the virtual environment name \n(micropython)\n before the \n>\n Prompt.  Once inside the virtual environment, use \npip\n to install \nesptool\n. \nesptool\n will be used to upload the MicroPython \n.bin\n firmware file onto the ESP8266-based microcontroller. Confirm that \nesptool\n is installed in the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment by running the command \nconda list\n. The list of commands below also creates a new directory in the \nDocuments\n folder called \nmicropython\n to store all the project files. \n\n\n> conda create -n micropython python=3.6\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > pip install esptool\n(micropython) > conda list\n(micropython) > cd Documents\n(micropython) > mkdir micropthon\n(micropython) > cd micropython\n\n\n\n\nDownload the latest MicroPython firmware .bin file\n\n\nGo to GitHub.com and download the latest \n.bin\n firmware file at \nmicropython.org/download#esp8266\n. Move the \n.bin\n firmware file to a new \nmicropython\n directory. The \n.bin\n firmware file is the version of MicroPython that runs on the ESP8266 microcontroller. Straight from the manufacturer, the ESP8266 microcontroller probably does not have MicroPyton installed, so we need to install MicroPython ourselves. After installing the Micropython \n.bin\n firmware file onto the board, we will be able to bring up the MicroPython REPL prompt, type commands into the Micropython REPL and run Micropython \n.py\n scripts on the board.\n\n\n\n\nInstall the SiLabs driver for the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nBefore we connect the ESP8266-based microcontroller such as an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 or ESP8266 NodeMCU to the computer, a specific driver needs to be installed. For Windows 10 laptop to see the board, the \nCP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP driver\n needs to be downloaded from SiLabs and installed. The driver download and installation is quick and easy but does require administrator privileges.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to the computer\n\n\nUse a microUSB cable (the same kind of cable that charges many mobile phones) to connect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to the computer. Make sure the microUSB cable is a full \nUSB data cable\n and not just a power only cable. If you have trouble getting the microcontroller to work, one reason might be the micoUSB cable you are using is only a charging cable and can not transfer data.\n\n\nDetermine which serial port the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to\n\n\nUse the Windows Device Manager to determine which serial port the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to is connected to. The serial port is one of the parameters which needs to be defined when the \n.bin\n firmware file is upload on the board.\n\n\nLook for something like \nSilicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM4)\n in the \nPorts (COM & LPT)\n menu of the Windows Device Manager. TCP210x USB to UART Bridge refers to the chip that handles serial communication on the board, not the ESP8266 chip itself. Make a note of the number after \n(COM )\n. The serial port number often comes up as \n(COM4)\n but it may be different on your computer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun esptool to upload the .bin file to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nOpen the Anaconda Prompt with the Windows Start Menu and \ncd\n(change directory) into the \nmicropython\n directory which contains the \n.bin\n file. Use the \ndir\n command to see the \nmicropython\n directory contents. Make sure the \n.bin\n firmware file is in the directory. The \n.bin\n firmware file is named something like \nesp8266-20171101-v1.9.3.bin\n. Activate the micropython virtual environment with the command \nconda activate micropython\n. Run \nesptool --help\n to ensure \nesptool\n is installed properly. Note there is no \n.py\n extension after \nesptool\n. On Windows , the command \nesptool\n works, but the command \nesptool.py\n may not. (Note this behavior is different than the commands shown on the \nMicroPython docs\n). If you try to run \nesptool\n and you are not in the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment, an error is returned. \n\n\n> cd Documents\n> cd micropython\n> pwd\nDocuments/micropython\n> dir\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > esptool --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore uploading the \n.bin\n firmware file to the ESP8266-based microcontoller, it is best practice to first erase the flash memory on the board using the command \nesptool erase_flash\n. Make sure to specify the \n--port\n. The argument after \n--port\n is the \nCOM\n port assigned to the ESP8266 board shown in the Windows Device Manager.  This port often comes up as \nCOM4\n.\n\n\n(micropython) > esptool --port COM4 erase_flash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can finally write the \n.bin\n firmware file to the flash memory on the microcontroller using the \nesptool write_flash\n command. Make sure to use the exact firmware file name you see sitting in the \nmicropython\n directory. The port needs to be set corresponding to the port you found in the Windows Device Manager. \n---baud\n is the baud rate or upload speed. I found that \n--baud 460800\n worked, but you could also specify \n--baud 115200\n which is slower. The upload time was a matter of seconds with either baud rate. The \n0\n after \n--flash_size=dectect\n means the firmware is written at the start of the flash memory (the 0th position) on the board. Again, make sure the \n.bin\n firmware file name is correct. The long file name is easy to mistype.\n\n\n(micropython) > esptool --port COM4 --baud 115200 write_flash \\\n--flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20171101-v1.9.3.bin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install PuTTY, a serial monitor\n\n\nNow that MicroPython is installed on the ESP8266-based microcontroller, we can communicate with our board over a serial connection. However, Windows doesn't have a built-in serial monitor (like \nscreen\n on MacOS and Linux). Therefore, if you are using the Windows operating system, you need to download and install a serial communication tool like \nPuTTY\n.\n\n\nPuTTY is a lightweight serial and SSH client for Windows. PuTTY provides an interface to communicate with the ESP8266-based microcontroller. \nPuTTY can be downloaded here\n. PuTTY is pretty small, and the download and installation are quick.\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the ESP8266-based Microcontroller with PuTTY\n\n\nEnsure the ESP8266-based microcontroller is connected to the computer with a USB cable and ensure the board is visible in the Windows Device Manager. Then use PuTTY to connect to the board over serial.  Make sure to specify the correct serial port in the \nSerial line\n box and set \n115200\n baud in the Speed box. \nMicropython is set to run at 115200 baud\n, other baud rates will lead to junk characters in the serial monitor. Make sure to select the \nSerial\n radio button below the header \nConnection type:\n near the top of the PuTTY window. Overlooking this detail is easy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \n>>>\n the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython prompt), MicroPython is successfully installed on your ESP8266-based microcontroller.\n\n\nSometimes, you may need to type [Enter] or Ctrl-D to bring up the \n>>>\n REPL prompt. If the \n>>>\n REPL prompt is not displayed in your PuTTY window, try to close PuTTY, unplug then replug the board and open PuTTY again. Most ESP8266-based microcontrollers also have a tiny little black RESET button that can be pressed to restart the board.  \n\n\n\n\nAt the \n>>>\n MicroPython REPL prompt try the following commands:\n\n\n>>> print('Problem Solving with MicroPython!')\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\n\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.platform\n'esp8266'",

The previous section detailed how to install MicroPython on an ESP8266-based microcontroller and how to install \nPuTTY\n on Windows.\n\n\nSummary of Steps\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to your computer with a USB cable\n\n\nDetermine which COM port the microcontroller is connected to using the Windows Device Manager \n\n\nOpen PuTTY and connect to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nRun commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\n\n\nConnect the ESP8266-based microcontroller to your computer with a USB cable\n\n\nUse a microUSB cable to connect the microcontroller to the computer. Make sure that the microUSB cable is a full USB data cable and not just a simple power cable. Cables that are just used to charge phones may only be power cables and may not be capable of transmitting data.\n\n\nDetermine which COM port the microcontroller is connected to using the Windows Device Manager\n\n\nUse the Windows Device Manager to determine which serial port the microcontroller is connected to. On Windows, the microcontroller usually comes up as \nCOM4\n. You can find the serial port by looking in the Ports (COM & LPT) category of the Windows Device Manager. Look for something like \nSilicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM4)\n in the \nPorts (COM & LPT)\n menu. It is the \nCOM#\n that's needed to connect to the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen PuTTY and connect to the ESP8266-based microcontroller\n\n\nEnsure the microcontroller is connected to your computer with a USB cable. Then initialize serial communication between the microcontroller and your computer with PuTTY. In PuTTY set the proper serial port (COM#) and 115200 baud. Remember to use the \n[Serial[\n radio button under \n[Connection Type:]\n to select serial communication or PuTTY will attempt to communicate with the microcontroller over SSH which won't work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn PuTTY, click \n[Open]\n  to bring up the MicroPython REPL prompt \n>>>\n. If you can't see the \n>>>\n prompt, try typing [Enter], [Ctrl]-[D], pushing the RESET button on the microcontroller or unplugging then replugging the USB cable.\n\n\n\n\nRun commands at the MicroPython REPL\n\n\nAt the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython command prompt \n>>>\n) try the following commands:\n\n\n>>> print('MicroPython for Engineers!')\nMicroPython for Engineers\n\n\n\n\nIf you import the \nsys\n module, you can see the MicroPython implementation and platform. \n\n\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.implementation\n(name='micropython', version=(1, 9, 3))\n>>> sys.platform\n'esp8266'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see similar output, that means MicroPython is working on the ESP8266-based microcontroller. You can also view the flash memory size of your microcontroller and the size of the MicroPython firmware you installed. Try the command below at the MicroPython prompt:\n\n\n>>> import port_diag\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the results above, you  can see the flash memory size is 4 MB. Below the label \nFirmware checksum:\n you can see a line for \nsize: 600872\n. \nsize: 600872\n means the size of the Micropythpon installation is about 600 KB or about 0.6 MB. Just over half a megabyte on the microcontroller and you are running a working version of Python!\n\n\nNow try a simple for loop. When you initiate a loop, the MicroPython REPL automatically indents the next line. A tab is not needed on code lines below a loop statement. To run the loop, type backspace on an empty line (to backspace away from an indented line) and hit [Enter].\n\n\n>>> for i in range(5):\n...     print(\"Problem Solving with MicroPython!\")\n...\n\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!\nProblem Solving with MicroPython!",

            "text": "Uploading Code\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to upload code to an ESP8266-based microcontroller with a tool called \nampy\n. The code in this section was written to turn the ESP8266-based microcontroller in a scrolling thermometer. The same upload method shown in this section can be used to upload MicroPython code you write to a ESP8266-based microcontroller.\n\n\nBefore MicroPython code is uploaded on the ESP8266-based microcontroller, MicroPython needs to be installed on the board. PuTTY also needs to be installed on you computer in order for the computer to communicate with the microcontroller over a serial connection.\n\n\nA previous section in this chapter detailed how to install MicroPython on an ESP9266 microcontroller and how to install PuTTY on a Windows. The procedures in this section are specific to the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller and the MCP9808 temperature sensor, both of which were used in a previous section. Other ESP8266-based microcontrollers and I2C sensors could be used instead, but the specifics of the procedure may be different from what's shown in this section.\n\n\nSummary of Steps\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nampy\n with \npip\n\n\nWrite MicroPython code \n\n\nUpload the MicroPython on code on the microcontroller with \nampy\n\n\nUnplug and then power up the Feather Huzzah and watch the temperature scroll by\n\n\n\n\nInstall ampy with pip\n\n\nAmpy\n is a Python package developed by Adafruit, a company that makes MicroPython compatible hardware. \nAmpy\n is used to push code stored on a computer onto a microcontroller running MicroPython. \nAmpy\n can be installed using the \nAnaconda Prompt\n. Alternatively, a terminal can be used to install \nampy\n. If you are using a virtual environment, active the virtual environment first then proceed with \nampy\n package installation.\n\n\n> conda activate micropython\n(micropython) > pip install adafruit-ampy\n(micropython) > ampy --help\n\n\n\n\nWrite MicroPython Code\n\n\nNow write the MicroPython code which you will uploaded on the microcontroller. The Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller contains two main Python files: \nboot.py\n and \nmain.py\n. But additional files can also be uploaded to the microcontroller. \nboot.py\n is the file that runs first when the board is powered up. First \nboot.py\n runs, then \nmain.py\n runs. An additional \n.py\n file can be added to the board to provide \nmain.py\n with a function to run.\n\n\nTwo different \n.py\n files will be constructed in this section. One \n.py\n file contains a function that reads the temperature off the temperature sensor. A second \n.py\n file calls the function in the first \n.py\n file and prints the temperature to the terminal window with a loop.\nThe first \nMCP9808.py\n file includes one function called \nreadtemp()\n. The \nreadtemp()\n function reads temperature recorded by the MCP9808 temperature sensor.  The \nreadtemp()\n function parses out the temperature data from the I2C bus on the MCP9808 temperature sensor and outputs the temperature in degrees C as a float.\n\n\nAt the top of \nMCP9808.py\n we need to import the \nmachine\n module to use the I2C bus. The \nmachine\n module provides a class to create a new I2C object. \n\n\nWhen the I2C object is instantiated, the \nscl\n and \nsda\n pins that the MCP9808 temperature sensor is connected to need to be specified. \nscl\n is the I2C clock line and \nsda\n is the I2C data line.  \nscl\n and \nsda\n  are pin 5 and pin 4 on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266. \n\n\nThe next part of the \nreadtemp()\n function creates a byte array. Data from the MCP9808 temperature sensor will be stored in the byte array. \n\n\nThe next part of the \nreadtemp()\n function in the \nMCP9808.py\n file uses the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method to read the temperature off the sensor. The first argument passed to the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the I2C bus address of the sensor. On the MCP9808 temperature sensor, the I2C bus address is \n24\n(if you type the line \n>>> i2c.scan()\n into the MicroPython REPL, the I2C bus address is returned). The next parameter passed to the  \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the register on the MCP9808 temperature sensor where the measured temperature is stored. On the MCP9808, the temperature is stored in register \n5\n. The third parameter passed to the  \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method is the variable we want to store the temperature data in. The \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method \nchanges\n the variable passed into the method as the third argument. Most Python methods modify the object the method operates on, but MicroPython's \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method changes the third variable passed to it, in our case the variable \nbyte_data\n. That's why we created the \nbyte_data\n variable before we called the \ni2c.readfrom_mem_into()\n method. \n\n\nThe last part of the \nreadtemp()\n function includes post-processing needed to convert the byte array into a temperature in degrees C. The final temperature in degrees C is a float\nThe entire contents of the \nMCP9808.py\n file are below:\n\n\n# MCP9808.py\n\n# Functions for the  MCP9808 temperature sensor\n# learn.adafruit.com/micropython-hardware-i2c-devices/i2c-master\n\ndef readtemp():\n    import machine\n    i2c = machine.I2C(scl=machine.Pin(5), sda=machine.Pin(4))\n    byte_data = bytearray(2)\n    i2c.readfrom_mem_into(24, 5, byte_data)\n    value = byte_data[0] << 8 | byte_data[1]\n    temp = (value & 0xFFF) / 16.0\n    if value & 0x1000:\n        temp -= 256.0\n    return temp\n\n\n\n\nNow construct a MicroPython script called \nmain.py\n which will use the function \nreadtemp()\n stored in \nMCP9808.py\n.\n\n\nThe \nmain.py\n script will import the \nMCP9808.py\n module and use the \nreadtemp()\n function to read the temperature from the MCP9808 temperature sensor. \n\n\nInside \nmain.py\n will be a loop that runs  for a total of 120 seconds. Each second the temperature is recorded. Inside the loop, the temperature is read off the MCP9808 temperature sensing using the \nMCP9808.readtemp()\n function.  \ntime.sleep(1)\n is inserted into the loop to wait one second between each measurement.\n\n\nThe complete \nmain.py\n file is below.\n\n\n# main.py\n\nimport MCP9808\nimport time\n\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nfor i in range(120):\n    data = MCP9808.readtemp()\n    print(data)\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\n\n\nUpload MicroPython Code to the ESP8266 Microcontroller with \nampy\n\n\nOnce the \nMCP9808.py\n file and the \nmain.py\n files are saved, both files can be uploaded on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller.\n\n\nEnsure the microcontroller is connected with a USB cable, and be aware of which serial port the microcontroller is connected to. \n\n\nUpload the \nMCP9808.py\n file and the \nmain.py\n file to the board using \nampy\n. Make sure you are in the directory with the \n.py\n files and that you are working in a virtual environment that has \nampy\n installed in it. In the example code below, the \n(micropython)\n virtual environment is active. The command \nampy --port COM4 ls\n lists the files stored on the microcontroller.\n\n\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 put MCP9808.py\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 put main.py\n(micropython) > ampy --port COM4 ls\nboot.py\nMCP9808.py\nmain.py\n\n\n\n\nUnplug and then power up the Feather Huzzah and watch the temperature scroll by\n\n\nThe Feather Huzzah needs to be restarted to run the \nmain.py\n file uploaded with \nampy\n. \n\n\nTo restart the board, unplug and then replug in the board's power (the USB cable). Once power is restored, the board will run through the \nboot.py\n script then start the \nmain.py\n script. When the board runs the \nmain.py\n script, the board will read the temperature from the MCP9808 temperature sensor then print the temperature out to the terminal. After two minutes the program should end.\n\n\nThe output below demonstrates the results shown in a terminal window.\n\n\n...\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.6875\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.6875\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.75\n25.8125\n25.8125\n25.8125\n25.75\n25.75\n25.8125\n>>>",

When you use virtual environments, one project can have a separate version of Python and packages.

By utilizing virtual environments, two projects on the same computer can use different versions of Python and different versions of packages.\n\n\nCreate a virtual environment with the Anaconda Prompt\n\n\nTo create the new virtual environment, open the \nAnaconda Prompt\n and issue the command:\n\n\n> conda create --name env_name python=3.6\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconda create\n command builds the new virtual environment. The \n--name env_name\n flag gives the new virtual environment the name \nenv_name\n.  Including \npython=3.6\n ensures the virtual environment has a current version of Python. \n\n\nThe following output or something similar results:\n\n\nThe following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n\n    ca-certificates: 2018.03.07-0           \n    certifi:         2018.11.29-py36_0      \n    libedit:         3.1.20170329-h6b74fdf_2\n    libffi:          3.2.1-hd88cf55_4       \n    libgcc-ng:       8.2.0-hdf63c60_1       \n    libstdcxx-ng:    8.2.0-hdf63c60_1       \n    ncurses:         6.1-he6710b0_1         \n    openssl:         1.1.1a-h7b6447c_0      \n    pip:             18.1-py36_0            \n    python:          3.6.8-h0371630_0       \n    readline:        7.0-h7b6447c_5         \n    setuptools:      40.6.3-py36_0          \n    sqlite:          3.26.0-h7b6447c_0      \n    tk:              8.6.8-hbc83047_0       \n    wheel:           0.32.3-py36_0          \n    xz:              5.2.4-h14c3975_4       \n    zlib:            1.2.11-h7b6447c_3      \n\nProceed ([y]/n)?\n\n\n\n\nType \ny\n to confirm and create the new virtual environment. \n\n\nActivate a virtual environment\n\n\nTo use the new virtual environment \nenv_name\n, it first needs to be activated:\n\n\n> conda activate env_name\n\n\n\n\nThe virtual environment is active when you see \n(env_name) >\n in parenthesis at the start of the prompt:\n\n\n(env_name) > \n\n\n\n\nInstall packages in a virtual environment\n\n\nWhen a new virtual environment is created, no packages are installed by default. If you use the Anaconda distribution of Python, the \nbase\n environment contains about 600 packages that come with Anaconda. But a fresh new virtual environment will just have Python installed, no other packages.\n\n\nTo install a package into the virtual environment \n(env_name)\n, first, make sure the environment is active (\n(env_name)\n before the prompt). Package installation is accomplished with the \nconda install\n command followed by the package name. To install Matplotlib into the virtual environment type:\n\n\n(env_name) > conda install matplotlib\n\n\n\n\nMultiple packages can be installed with the same command. To install both NumPy and Jupyter use:\n\n\n(env_name) > conda install numpy jupyter\n\n\n\n\nDeactivate a virtual environment\n\n\nTo deactivate an active environment, use:\n\n\n(env_name) > conda deactivate\n>\n\n\n\n\nWhen the virtual environment is deactivated, the prompt looks normal \n>\n, with no environment name in parenthesis before it.\n\n\nList your virtual environments\n\n\nView a list of your virtual environments using the command \nconda info --envs\n or \nconda env list\n.\n\n\n> conda activate env_name\n(env_name) > conda info --envs\n\n# conda environments:\n#\nbase                     /home/tribilium/anaconda3\nenv_name               * /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/env_name\nmatplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \n*\n asterisk on the line with \nenv_name\n.
