## Installing Python from Python.org
Below are the recommended ways to install a new version of Python on the three major operating systems: Windows, Mac OSx and Linux. This book is based on Python version 3.6.  Some of the problems may not work properly on legacy Python (version 2.7).  I recommend using the Anaconda distribution of Pytho on Windows and MacOSX. The installation of Anaconda is detailed in the next section. 

### Installing Python on Windows

Go to [https://Python.org/downloads)[https://Python.org/downloads] to download the latest release. Make sure to select the box [add Python to my path] during the installation.
