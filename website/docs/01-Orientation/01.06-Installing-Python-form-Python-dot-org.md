## Installing Python from Python.org
Below are the recommended ways to install a new version of Python from Python.org on the three major operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux. This book is based on Python version 3.6.  Some of the problems may not work properly on legacy Python (version 2.7).  I recommend using the Anaconda Distribution of Python on Windows and MacOSX. The installation of Anaconda was detailed in previous sections.
### Installing Python on Windows

Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest release. Make sure to select the box [add Python to my path].

### Installing Python on Linux

Open a terminal and enter ```$ python``` to see if a version of Python is already installed on the system. If the Python version is 2.7 or below, download the newest release in the apt repositories.

```text
$ sudo apt-get python3.6
```

After installation, you will need to append your PATH environment variable to ensure the newly installed Python3.6 version is the version of Python called when using the terminal.
