The creation of this book and supporting material would not be possible without the gracious support of my wife and family. Students at Portland Community College continue to give me hope that the next generation of engineers will be a diverse group of team problem solvers.

The Python Data Science Handbook and Machine Learning in Python as well as Reiman Equations in Python served as inspiration and examples of using Jupyter Notebooks to construct a book. The bookbook repository on github provided a starting point for the tooling to convert the book from Nupyter Notebooks to the web and into LaTeX for printing.
