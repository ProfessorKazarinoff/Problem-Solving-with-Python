## What is a Jupyter Notebook?
A Jupyter notebook is sort of half way between the Python REPL and a Python module .py file. 

Jupyter notebooks run in a web browser like Google Chrome where as .py files are edited with a text editor like notepad. Regular .py files only contain Python commands and comments. Jupyter notebooks contain two types of cells: code cells and markdown cells. Lines of Python code are run in code cells. Markdown cells contain comment like descriptions to describe code cells.
