There are four connections: A 3V power line from the Feather Huzzah to the MCP9808 Vdd pin, GND connected between both boards, and the I2C data and clock lines connected between the two boards. On the Feather Huzzah ESP8266, the I2C data line is SDA (pin 4) and the I2C clock line is SCL (pin 5). These connect with the MPC9808 I2C data line SDA and the MPC9808 I2C clock line SCL. Unlike Serial communication where RX connects to TX, in I2C communication SDA connects to SDA and SCL connects to SCL.\n",

Then create an empty ```bytearray``` which will store the data coming in from the MCP9808 temperature sensor. As strings in Micropython are UTF-8 encoded by default (like in Python 3), a _bytearray_ needs to be used to read the raw output from the MCP9808 chip registers. The command ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` method brings in the data from the sensor and saves it to the ```byte_data``` variable. The arguments inside the ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` method ```24``` and ```5``` correspond to the I2C memory address and registry address of the temperature data stored in the MCP9808 temperature sensor.   \n",
