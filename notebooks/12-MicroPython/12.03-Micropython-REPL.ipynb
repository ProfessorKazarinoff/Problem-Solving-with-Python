See the [previous post]({filename}micropython_install.md) on how to install Micropython on the board and install [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) on a Windows 10 machine."

    "Now let's turn the Feather Huzzah's built-in LED on and off. The Feather Huzzah has a built-in red LED connected to Pin 0. We can access this LED with Micropython's ```machine``` module. First we use the ```machine``` module to create a ```Pin``` object. The first argument when we instantiate the ```Pin``` object is the pin number on the board (in this case ```0```). Pin zero on the Feather Huzzah is connected to the built-in red LED. The second argument is the pin type. We want Pin 0 to act as an output pin (```machine.Pin.OUT```). We are going to assign our ```pin``` the attribute ```.on()``` or ```.off()```. This will cause the Feather board to output a positive voltage or no voltage to Pin 0 to turn the built-in red LED on and off. You can also connect Pin 0 to an LED through a resistor (then to ground) and have this LED turn on and off.\n",
