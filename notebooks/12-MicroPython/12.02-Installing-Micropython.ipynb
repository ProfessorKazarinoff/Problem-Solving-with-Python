I found that ```--baud 460800``` worked, but you could also specify ```--baud 115200``` which is slower. The upload time was a matter of seconds with either baud rate. The ```0``` after ```--flash_size=dectect``` means we want the firmware to be written at the start of the flash memory (the 0th position) on the board. Again, make sure the .bin firmware file name is correct. It is easy to mistype. Another issue I ran into was that I tried to use the command ```esptool.py``` instead of ```esptool``` as shown on the [Micropython docs](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html#deploying-the-firmware).
