Many code editors, including Jupyter notebooks, auto-indent the code within a loop. If the indentation is added manually, 4 spaces is standard.\n",

If the while statement can't be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```, Python will throw an error. It is therefore necessary to convert the user's input from a string to a float. The statement ```'5' < 0``` does note evaluate to ```True``` or ```False```, because the string ```'5'``` can't be compared to the number ```0```. "
