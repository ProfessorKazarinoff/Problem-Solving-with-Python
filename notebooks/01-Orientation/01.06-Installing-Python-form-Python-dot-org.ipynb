    "Below are the recommended ways to install a new version of Python on the three major operating systems: Windows, Mac OSx and Linux. This book is based on Python version 3.6.  Some of the problems may not work properly on legacy Python (version 2.7).  I recommend using the Anaconda distribution of Pytho on Windows and MacOSX. The installation of Anaconda is detailed in the next section. \n",
